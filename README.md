# AnyGym API

API & Database interactions for AnyGym data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

If you don't already have glide, install it.

```
curl https://glide.sh/get | sh
```

Install project dependencies

```
glide install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Set environment

You'll want to set the correct environment before running migrations or
starting the web server.

For testing...

```
export GOENV=test
```

For local development...

```
export GOENV=local
```

## Running the migrations

Run all of the database migrations to build the db and populate
necassary static data

```
go run store/migrations/migrate.go -up
```

Run all of the database migrations to delete all data and completely tear down the database

```
go run store/migrations/migrate.go -down
```

## Build the project

Run the go build command from the root of the project

```
go build
```

## Start the web server

Run the executable generated by building the project

```
./anygym.api
```

You can also use [CompileDaemon](https://github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon) to automatically build the project and start the web server each time a files changes.

```
CompileDaemon -command=./anygym.api
```

## Running the tests

Run all of the automated tests with the test shell script.

```
source test.sh
```

Or run them manually w/ the go test command.

```
export GOENV=test
go run store/migrations/migrate.go -up
go test -cover -v $(go list ./... | grep -v /vender/)
```

Or run a single test suite using the go test command

```
go test ./store/datastore -v
```

where ./store/datastore is the path to the dir containing the test suite

### Break down into end to end tests
